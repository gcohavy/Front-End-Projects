      <p>Computer Programming is an intricate subject that may be very intimidating to start studying, but really it is not so complicated.</p>

<p>All of programming begins with the basic concept of ones and zeros. The most basic way to think of this is as switches. The light switch in your bedroom completes the circuit that allows electricity to go into a light bulb, lighting it up. Computers are a much more complicated version of that. It is a very long series of logical steps that connects the button that you press with its reaction on the screen. When you press a button on your keyboard, it triggers a switch in your currently running program to trigger a switch in your memory to then trigger any number of switches to do an almost limitless number of things.</p>

<li> Computers these days are so complex that it would be virtually impossible to fully grasp how to build one from scratch. Every single pixel on your screen has its own series of switches. Furthermore, you are also controlling how much electricity is allowed through each switch, sort of like a dimmer setting.</li>
<li>Every single byte of memory is actually a series of 8 or more switches, called 'bits', so now imagine how many switches are involved in a 20 gigabyte game.</li>

    <header>Digital vs Analog</header>
    <article>
    <p>So you have heard the words "digital" and "analog" before, but what do they really mean? What's the difference and how does each one affect the specific product you are purchasing?</p>

<p>The answer is quite simple. If you were pouring water from the tea kettle into a cup, you would end up with practically the same amount of water that you started out with. But if you then poured that cup back into the kettle, and then into another cup and then back into the first cup, you will have lost a few drops along the way. The same concept applies to electricity. The more it needs to travel the more voltage you lose along the way. Additionally, the more the electricity needs to travel, the more opportunity for things to alter or disturb the flow. This disturbance in the electric current is called 'noise'.</p>
<p>An analog system attempts to shorten the number of steps between each reaction so as not to lose the desired voltage and reduce the amount of noise. Digital systems, on the other hand, reset their voltage at each switch. Each switch triggers a new release into the next one. With this system, digital systems can go through a thousand switches and still end up with the original voltage and clear current.</p>

        <p>'Algorithm' is another fancy computer programming word, but that doesn't mean it's beyond your capablitities to understand.</p>
        <p>When learning how to code, you will start with basic programs that will do one or maybe two tasks. The order that you do it is either insignificant or too simple to take up any of your time in planning it; but when a program gets more comlicated, the blueprint becomes more important. Take Waze, for example. It needs to choose what is the fastest way to navigate you from point A to point B. First, it needs to decide which streets are options. Then, it collects the average speed from its users on all the applicable roads. Then it adds up the numbers and returns the route with the lowest number. This plan is called an algorithm. (Obviously this was a made up and simple version of what the Waze algorithm actually looks like).</p>
        <p>The algorithm is the most complicated part of computer programming. After entering the field, you will be constantly competing to create the most efficient algorithms.</p>

      <p>What links ones and zeros to the programming languages? How do we go from simple switches to an intricate program capable of unlimited potential?</p>
      <p>The program where you write code is called a compiler. Someone has set up the series of switches to accept certain inputs and use them to make simple things happen. Those simple things, like making the letter 'a' appear on your screen, can then be combined to create the most complicated of programs, just like making a single letter is relatively simple, but then using those letters we are able to write a 1000 page fantasy novel.</p>
      <p>The compiler was built to be similar to legos, in that with a limited number of different legos, many different designs can still be made. Newer compilers are made using the older compilers, for example C++ was built using C.</p>

    <p>
You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
    </p>
    <p>
Most programming languages will have you declare a variable before you can use it. For example:<code>int a = 4;</code> SO what is this sentence doing?  
    </p>
    <p>
In this program, the "int" part (stands for 'integer') tells the program to assign a 16 switch memory section to the following "a". Now, if you type "a" anywhere in the program, it will link you to whatever was stored in its memory. The "=" sign will then assign something to that memory section. in this case it is a 4. Now, in the future of this program, if you use "a" for anything, it will look at what is stored there and come up with 4. In programming terms, "a" is now a key to the value "4".

    <article> 
To get you started with writing code, all tutorials will have you start with a "Hello World" program, and it will look something like this:
<code>function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");
</code>
This is a simple code. Learn it so you can avoid relearning the same thing for every language. Now good luck, and remember: it isn't about winning, it's about making the most money.
